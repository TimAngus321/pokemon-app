# Pokemon App Challenge

**Pokemon Search is a react app that performs the following taks:**

- Web page that allows user to enter a pokemon name

- Submit a query to Pokeapi and display the given pokémon's name, number, sprite or error message if no match is found

- Provide “Previous” & “Next” buttons, that switch to the previous/next pokemons, base on their id number

- Provide a text-based search feature, where inputting a name or partial name should look for a matching pokemon and show it

**Unable to complete in time:**

- Have at least two automated tests, for the two features above.
